# Steps
## 1. [22,27,16,2,18,6]
[22,27,16,2,18,6] ->
[16,22,27,2,18,6] -> 
[2,16,22,27,18,6] -> 
[2,16,18,22,27,6] -> 
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

## 2. 11 ~= 2n -> O(N)

## 3. Best Case: O(N)

## 4. Worst Case: O(N^2)

## 5. [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,16]
[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,16] -> 
[3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,16] -> 
[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,16] -> 
[2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,16] -> 
[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]
